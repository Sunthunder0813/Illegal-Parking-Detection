CRITICAL: You need to provide a .hef file!

EASIEST OPTION - Download from Hailo Model Zoo:
  1. Visit: https://github.com/hailo-ai/hailo_model_zoo
  2. Download yolov8n HEF for hailo8l
  3. Copy to: /home/set-admin/Illegal-Parking-Detection/yolov8n.hef

OR use Hailo's example models:
  ls /usr/share/hailo-models/

Falling back to CPU inference (WILL BE VERY SLOW!).
⚠️ Setting up CPU inference (Ultralytics YOLO).
   WARNING: CPU inference on Pi 5 is ~1-2 FPS. Get a HEF file for ~30+ FPS!
